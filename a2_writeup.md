# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The difficult part of completing the match function was largely just conceptualizing the whole thing. Until it was finished,
I had some difficulty wrapping my head around what parts of it worked and what parts didn't.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match function could be used to isolate relevant details from a query to then be forwarded to the database (ex. if match returns
"acted in" and "The Thing" we can use that as directions to reference a list of actors in The Thing stored in the database).
